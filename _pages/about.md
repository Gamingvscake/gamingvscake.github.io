My name is Chris Thompson and welcome to my website! I am a software developer who specializes in designing games in the Unity engine.

A history course
======
I originally grew up in [Carrollton, Texas](https://www.google.com/maps/place/carrollton+tx/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x864c212bbbdd571f:0x9c1efd49b3841d5d?sa=X&ved=1t:155783&ictx=111), and was raised there the majority of my life. It wasn't until 2014 when I moved to Ontario, Canada. I spent the majority of my life indoors playing with electronics. I was fascinated by computers and how they worked, and would constantly take apart electronics to learn how they work. Another fascination with electronics was my love for video games. I grew up with Nintendo and Playstation, and always had a computer with Steam on it. I always knew I wanted to pursue a career in software development, but it wasn't until I played [Super Mario Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey) when I realized that I wanted to make games just as impactful.

I spent the last few years of high school working in coding languages such as C#, C++, HTML and PHP and after graduating, I was accepted into Sheridan College's Bachelor of Game Design. Unfortunately, this was in 2020 when COVID hit schools hard, and I decided to pause my education until schools resumed being in person. I moved to Kitchener, Ontario during this time and continued my education in Game Design at Conestoga College, and graduated in April 2025.

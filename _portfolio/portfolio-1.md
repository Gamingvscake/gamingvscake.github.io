Waves and Wizards was a pitch idea I created in September 2024, and presented it to 50 other students in my course. Fortunately, my game and only 6 others got greenlit into becoming real projects and I became the project lead, working alongside 7 other student developers over 8 months to create a feature finished project. My team and I will be presenting Waves and Wizards at Ubisoft's Level Up in Toronto mid April.
